# FSN-Syntax-Validator

## What Does It Do?
Simple, this program is a parser implemented using Flex and Bison that validates
the syntactic correctness of Fuzzy Set Notation strings passed in.

## How Do I Get It?
First you need to clone the repo. Once you do that run the following command:
```
make
```
That will produce the program **checker1**.

## How Do I Use It?
Once you *make* the program you can run it using the following command:
```
./checker1
```
After you run the program it will halt for an input string. Once the input
string is entered, press enter, and the program will return the result.
